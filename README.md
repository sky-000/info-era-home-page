🌐 Landing Page – Internship Project
This is a simple landing page I created during my internship to practice and apply front-end web development skills. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, focusing on clean layout and basic design principles.

💡 This project helped me understand how to structure and style a real-world web page. It was a great experience working on something meaningful during my internship!

🛠️ Technologies Used:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript (basic)

While it’s not responsive yet, it lays a strong foundation that I plan to improve in future versions. Always learning, always building!
